Quickly unscramble the countries word search created by [@czechophile](https://twitter.com/czechophile) and [@roblangham](https://twitter.com/roblangham) seeing as they forgot which countries they had added to it.

The matrix is contained within `matrix.txt` and lowercase, whitespace stripped countries are contained within `dictionary.txt`.
